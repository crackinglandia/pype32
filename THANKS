I just want to say thanks to the following people/projects:

- PECOFF documentation from Microsoft.
- y0da for the original Binary Corpus project.
- Ange Albertini & corkami project for the custom PE samples.
- marciano and VortiCe for their help with the design of the library, bugfixing and support.
- Daniel Pistelli for CFF Explorer Suite and his work with the .NET format.
